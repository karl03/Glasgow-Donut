# GALLANT â€” Glasgow City Portrait: Donut Diagram

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## STYLE GUIDE
Function Names: PascalCase
Variable Names: camelCase

## Data Storage
All graph data is stored in "server/data.json", though this should only be modified through the admin page, to ensure format is kept correct.

Icons are stored within their respective subfolders in "Server/Icons/"

The report file is stored in "Server/Report/", but is best modified through the admin page.

## Useful Commands
*As a minor warning, do not run* `npm install` *or equivalent* `npm` *commands as this will generate an additional set of dependency files.*

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Builds and runs the page locally, then accessible through localhost:5000, with the admin page on localhost:5000/admin

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

If you have issues with missing dependencies, run:
### `yarn install`
If the issue persists after this, contact a team-memeber.
